# Introduction to NodeJS Course Material
The course covers basic NodeJS and Express concepts and has been taught by the Minsait Valladolid front team in December 2021.

This project was bootstrapped with [Express Generator Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator-typescript) which is based in [Express Generator](https://expressjs.com/es/starter/generator.html).

## Download and Install
After downloading the repository from Github, enter the following commands into your command line from the project folder:

`npm install`

`npm start`

Then go to localhost:3000


## Each Lesson is a Git Branch
To view the code for a given lesson, checkout the appropriate branch name. The branch will have the finished code from that lesson.

## Installing lesson branches
All the branches are checked out to your local machine automatically when you do npm install. Just do a git branch to verify and see all branches after. If they didn't appear, try running npm run branches to download all the branches.

To view a branch: git checkout [branch-name]
